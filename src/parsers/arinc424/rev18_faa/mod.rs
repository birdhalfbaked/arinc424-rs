//!
//! - The published **ICAO Airport Identifier** is used whenever available.
//! - If no ICAO identifier exists, the published FAA Airport Identifier is used.
//! - The **IATA Code** field contains the FAA Airport Identifier.
//! - If the airport identifier is four characters long, the IATA field is left blank.
//! - The **Longest Runway (5.54)** field does **not always represent the longest hard-surface runway** at the airport.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Runways
//!
//! - Runway suffixes include:
//!   - `W` — Water
//!   - `S` — Soft surface

//!
//! Otherwise a DB record is used.
//!
//! ## Additional Rules

//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA)
//!
//! Normally:
//!
//! - MSA Center Fix is coded on the FAF.

//! 5. Existing procedures are updated gradually, with preference given to updating all procedures at an airport together.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Route Qualifier 2
//!
//! Route Qualifier 2:
